Prowiz4PC: ProWizard for PC
---------------------------


Description
-----------

Pro-Wizard-1 (for Peecee) is a multi-ripper for music files. (find the
list in the known formats below). Also, it extracts various data/exe files
like S404 data files. Most of the music formats are 100% Protracker compatible.
The ripped formats are ALL amiga formats ! .. for this version of Pro-Wizard
anyway :).

Note
----

USE THIS PROGRAM ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK !
If this program destroys your data I'm interested in finding the bug,
but I'm not responsible for the damages.

Legal issues
------------

The copyright is GNU GPL. See COPYING file.

Requirements
------------

prowiz (cmdline tool):
        At this stage, only Linux/FreeBSD are supported.
	No MS-DOS/WIN* binary in this package anymore.
	Grab the other packages for other archies.

Behaviour
---------

Output, upon finding a known data file, will be 0.extension, 1.extension, etc. .
These extensions are editable in the file "_types_" (default name). Read the 
header of this file for specific instructions on how to edit.
At this stage, I still cant guarantee the program wont crash in certain cases.
I fixed anything I've found so far, but .. . If you encounter such a case,
please, send over the data file !.

Motivation
----------

"I wanted to do it myself" is the main motivation :).
