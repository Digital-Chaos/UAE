Prowiz4PC: ProWizard for PC
---------------------------


Description
-----------

Pro-Wizard-1 (for Peecee) is a multi-ripper for music files. (find the
list in the known formats below). Also, it extracts various data/exe files
like S404 data files. Most of the music formats are 100% Protracker compatible.
The ripped formats are mainly amiga formats. I'm beginning to add a few
other from the Atari ST, now.

Note
----

USE THIS PROGRAM ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK !
If this program destroys your data I'm interested in finding the bug,
but I'm not responsible for the damages.

Legal issues
------------

The copyright is GNU GPL. See COPYING file.

Requirements
------------

prowiz (cmdline tool):
        At this stage, only Linux/FreeBSD are supported.
	MS-DOS/WIN* binary are compiled by friends when spare time comes up.

Behaviour
---------

Output, upon finding a known data file, will be 0.extension, 1.extension, etc. .
These extensions are editable in the file "_types_" (default name). Read the 
header of this file for specific instructions on how to edit.
At this stage, I still can't guarantee the program wont crash in certain cases.
I fixed anything I've found so far, but .. . If you encounter such a case,
please, send over the data file !.

Motivation
----------

"I wanted to do it myself" is the main motivation :).

Compiling
---------

 A simple 'make' should do the trick.
 Now, if you want a version that contains only the music files (WinUAE ?),
edit the 'makefile' and remove the '-DINCLUDEALL'. then 'make simple' will
compile only the needed files.
 Sounds like bad work on the makefile, but I wasn't able to make it any
simplier. Sorry.
